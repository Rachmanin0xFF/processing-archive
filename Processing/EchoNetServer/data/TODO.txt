Sadly the source code for EchoNet can't be put into EchoNet due to
the fact that it uses those "special characters" which would
corrupt the commands if you typed them.

:(

So, to clarify, unused characters are:
	-The little squiggly thing
 -The little backwards apostrophe (SHIFT+squiggly)

Also, at the moment, EchoNet has some difficulty with users
inputting newlines when others are typing below them.

It's pretty annoying to fix, actually.

Also doing non-squish line updating is actually pretty fast,
all of the information is sent in the same tick as the same String.

That's all.
