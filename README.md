# processing-archive
I learned to program in [Processing](https://processing.org/), a lovely software sketchbook for learning how to code (it's Java with some fluff to make graphics easier).

This archive is a giant dump of my learning process, hobby projects, and more.

There is bad code in here. There is (some) good code in here. I don't even remember writing some of it.

Hic sunt dracones!
