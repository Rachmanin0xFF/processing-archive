I learned to program in [Processing](https://processing.org/), a lovely software sketchbook for learning how to code (it's Java with some fluff to make graphics easier).

This repository is digital proof of that learning process.

There is bad code in here. There is good code in here (well, rarely). I don't even remember writing some of it.

Hic sunt dracones!
